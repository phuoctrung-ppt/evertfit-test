# Everfit Test

This project is a test for Everfit.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, to run the development server, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The data in this project has been mocked using MSW (Mock Service Worker) and Faker. 

If the data doesn't show up, please refresh the page as the Faker generates random data each time.

## Dependencies

- [MSW](https://mswjs.io/)
- [Faker](https://fakerjs.dev/)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the data not displaying, try refreshing the page. The random data generation by Faker might sometimes require a refresh to display correctly.
